# IsItAlive
Using Wikipedia API to check if a celeb is live or dead
Just download the script and run it in python

Enter the first and last name of a Celeb and the script will tell you if she/he/it are alive or dead
Unfortenatly Wiki choose their side, and while they donâ€™t recognize Ruth Gonzales as a proper celeb it does recognize Sigal Shachmon...
So sorry all the gonzi (Ruth Gonzales fan club) out there
